# Vocal Tutor

## Description

This is my first group project after I learned how to code (Matlab was my first language). I tried to break the program down into small parts to implement the features using those small parts. It is a vocal tutor program that analyzes a person’s singing characteristics. The user can test or practice their vocal skills by choosing from the four main MATLAB features. An additional challenge of this project was implementing my own fft conversion, which I called mfft.

- The first feature will determine the user’s vocal type; the program plays notes from each of the four vocal types–soprano, alto, tenor, and bass–and counts each note that is sung property. After all the notes are sung, the program will tell the user which vocal types they fit best. There is also a shortened demo of the first feature that only plays a note from each vocal range. 
- The second feature involves the user singing notes from one of the four vocal ranges. After each note is sung, the program reports back to the user how accurate each note is. 
- The third feature is a game where multiple people compete against each other in singing notes from a selected vocal range. The player with the most overall pitch accuracy wins the game. 
- The fourth feature shows a live fast Fourier transform (FFT); specifically, the program displays a single­sided amplitude spectrum graph at about 1.8 frames per second of the microphone input.
