# Enigma

## Description

This group project is the verilog implementation of an encryption device inspired by the WW2 era german Enigma Machine. To scramble letters the machine uses 3 rotors, each can be selected from 5 unique types of rotors that sets letters to become other letters.

An Altera board and a keyboard is sufficient to encode and decode messages, but a sound box and a VGA display can be added for additional features.
