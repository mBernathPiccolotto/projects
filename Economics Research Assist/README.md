# Economics Reseach Assist

## Description

During the summer of 2019 one of my flat-mates was doing economics research. His project
consisted of going through several resumes and counting the number of publications in each
of a few selected Journals. To help him out I created this program that allows the mannual
review to be done with a few clicks and keeps count of the pub lications for him. Unfortunatley
it was nbot possible to fully automate the process with the time constraints as parsing resumes
is a really big challenge.
